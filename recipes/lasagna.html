        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This lasagna recipe has “rainy Sunday cooking project” written all over it. But, if you’re into meal prep, you can make the cheesy
             béchamel and the meaty ragù ahead and pop them into the fridge or freezer. You can also assemble a tray of homemade lasagna in 
             advance and freeze it unbaked for at least a month (and probably longer).</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>Fresh tomato sauce</li>
            <li>Seasoned beef</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 225°. Mix 2 lb. ground pork and 1 lb. ground beef chuck (20% fat) with your hands in a large bowl;
                 season generously with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, then mix again. Form into about 18 large meatballs
                  (they don’t need to be perfect—you’ll be mashing them later).</li>
            <li>Warm 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-high heat. Working in 2 batches,
                FreFresh tomato saucesh tomato sauce cook meatballs, turning occasionally and reducing heat if bottom of pot looks in danger
                 of scorching, until browned all over, about 6 minutes per batch. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet as they’re done.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium. Add 2 oz. pancetta (Italian bacon) or slab bacon, chopped, to pot and cook, stirring often, until lightly
                browned and beginning to crisp, about 5 minutes. Add 1 medium onion, finely chopped, 1 celery stalk, finely chopped,
                1 medium carrot, peeled, finely chopped, and 6 garlic cloves, sliced, and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened,
                6–8 minutes. Add 2 Tbsp. tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until paste is darkened in color, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add ¾ cup dry white wine and cook, stirring occasionally, until almost completely evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add one 28-oz.
                can whole peeled tomatoes, crushing with your hands, and increase heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring occasionally,
                until liquid is jammy and reduced by about half, 8–10 minutes. Add 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth and 1 cup whole milk,
                then return meatballs to pot. Bring to a simmer. Cover pot partially with a lid, transfer to oven, and cook, 
                checking every hour or so to ensure liquid is at a low simmer and adjusting oven temperature as needed, until meatballs
                are falling-apart tender, 3–4 hours.</li>
            <li>Using a potato masher, break meatballs apart and incorporate into liquid (you should have about 8 cups ragù; transfer pot to stovetop
                 and simmer gently to reduce if needed). Taste and season with more salt and black pepper if needed.
                Do ahead: Ragù can be made 4 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill, or freeze up to 3 months.</li>
        </ol>
